My primary role is with the Teaching English Association for Monastic Schools (TEAMS) programme which operates with the support of Fὄrderverein Myanmar e.V.  https://www.help-myanmar.net/wp/?cat=42. I teach English language classes and also deliver Teaching Methodology to trainee teachers on a 10-month training programme, simultaneously developing their English language skills to attain higher levels of proficiency. Besides developing the Teaching Methodology element of the programme, which also involves providing guidance and support during classroom practice, I have developed a set of ‘Golden Teacher Standards’ in consultation with PDO’s practicing teachers; which are entirely consistent with the Myanmar Ministry of Education’s Teacher Competency Standards Framework (Beginning Teachers) July 2017. In addition, I have trained and supported teachers working in PDO’s mainstream school; Fast Track school; and non-formal school. As well as gaining experience of working in Myanmar education in this urban setting, I have also spent ‘outreach’ time training teachers in rural communities, on a residential basis. Therefore I have seen first-hand and heard about the obstacles and problems of keeping children and youngsters in education directly from teachers, parents and students. Consequently, I have some knowledge and understanding of issues now being addressed by Myanmar’s National Education Strategic Plan 2016-2021. In April 2017, I led a team of volunteers in planning, organising and delivering an inaugural week-long English Camp for students at the Inle Heritage Hospitality Vocational Training Centre. I am also familiar with the work of the Monastic Education Development Group, MEDG (an INGO based at PDO) in the field of non-formal education. They are currently developing a network of ‘digital schools’ located in remote rural areas which receive ‘broadcasts’ of engaging interactive lessons; facilitated by Telenor. I am currently developing a short, intensive programme to support candidates seeking international academic scholarships at Master’s level.

I have designed and delivered education programmes at primary, secondary, undergraduate, post-graduate and Masters levels. In recent years, my focus has been the delivery of quality initial teacher education and continuing professional development for teachers in the diverse settings of cosmopolitan east London; the rural Ayeyarwaddy Delta; and urban Mandalay. I have worked at a national level in the UK’s Higher Education Academy.  I was responsible for supporting a team of consultants to expand the research capacity and ‘professionalisation’ of a host of disciplines in the field of Health Sciences and Practice. We ran various conferences and workshops in universities. I established special interest groups and facilitated their meetings and disseminated information and research outcomes across the Health Sciences and Practice network.  In another management role, I was the first Principal Lecturer for Quality Learning & Teaching at the London Metropolitan University, responsible for the development and implementation of a range of quality assurance systems required by this new university.  I also possess the specific technical knowledge required to provide advice and guidance to students seeking scholarships to study abroad (so valued in Myanmar); experience of being sensitive to Buddhist culture; and the interpersonal and communication skills necessary to establish and maintain good working relationships in a foreign university like Phaung Daw Oo International University – which operates in an English-speaking environment.";
